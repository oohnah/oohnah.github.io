					Gravity Girl is a hero that I created for my character design class, and has the power to change her gravitational pull
					to attract and repel objects around her. She is part of a larger universe that I had already created, dubbed the Pocket Girl Universe after my first hero character, Pocket Girl. The universe full of heroes who have powers based on
					pseudo science, and you can see more work relating to Pocket Girl and Gravity Girl <a href="http://ameliartist.tumblr.com/tagged/pgu">here</a>.
