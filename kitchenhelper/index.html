			Kitchen Helper is a UI concept for a futuristic kitchen app. Implemented with augmented reality contact lenses, Kitchen Helper provides a variety of recipes and the means to execute them. Find recipes that suit the ingredients of your fridge, order custom-portioned ingredients to your door, and get tips throughout your cooking process. Below are links to a rough prototype for the main interface, and a user testing survey. Please keep in mind that the protoype exists to convey design ideas and is not fully functional!
