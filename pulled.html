					<br>
					For my Interaction Design class, we were tasked to design a web app that functions as a tracker.
					I chose to create a comic book tracker, to help people keep track of the different comic books that
					they have read. We spent a few months going through various iteration and user testing phases, resulting
					in a prototype. Please note that the protoype only exists to give a general idea of the intended design. <b>It does not fully work and has a few missing pages.</b> You can <a href="pulledprocess.pdf">click here</a> to see my process document, or
